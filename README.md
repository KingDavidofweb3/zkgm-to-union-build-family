Honestly, the more I learn about Union, the more it just makes sense.

Instead of wrapping tokens and relying on risky bridges, it just proves your assets are real — wherever you need them.

No copies.
No confusion.
Just your real token, verifiable on any chain.

It’s one of those ideas that feels obvious in hindsight... but also super powerful once you see it.

Less friction. More trust.
ZK tech doing exactly what it should.

Union isn’t just fixing problems — it’s quietly upgrading how Web3 works.

And honestly? That’s refreshing.
